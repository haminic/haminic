# Hi there 👋

## ▸ About 📖

Welcome to my Github! I'm Ham, or if you prefer, Kittichet Arayasujin. I'm currently a computer engineering student at Chulalongkorn University. Here, you’ll find repos with personal $\LaTeX$ notes on subjects I'm interested in, including (but not limited to) math, physics, and computer science, as well as future coding projects I'll be working on.
